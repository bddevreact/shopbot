# Railway Deployment Checklist âœ…

## Files Created/Updated for Railway Deployment

### âœ… Railway Configuration Files
- **Procfile** - Defines the worker process command
- **runtime.txt** - Specifies Python 3.11.0 runtime
- **railway.json** - Railway-specific deployment configuration
- **.gitignore** - Prevents sensitive files from being committed

### âœ… Dependencies
- **requirements.txt** - Updated and cleaned for Railway compatibility
  - Removed `pathlib` (built-in module)
  - All dependencies are Railway-compatible

### âœ… Code Updates
- **bot.py** - Updated to handle Railway environment variables
  - Graceful fallback from config.env to system environment variables
  - Railway-friendly error messages
  - Better error handling for missing config files

### âœ… Documentation
- **RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Complete deployment guide
- **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - This checklist

## Pre-Deployment Steps

1. **âœ… Code is Railway-ready**
2. **âœ… Dependencies are compatible**
3. **âœ… Environment variable handling updated**
4. **âœ… Sensitive files excluded from Git**
5. **ðŸ“‹ Set up Railway account**
6. **ðŸ“‹ Connect GitHub repository**
7. **ðŸ“‹ Configure environment variables in Railway**
8. **ðŸ“‹ Deploy and test**

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Bot starts without errors
- [ ] Admin commands work
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] Cryptocurrency address generation works
- [ ] Order processing works
- [ ] Logs are accessible in Railway dashboard

## Notes

- The bot will automatically create default configuration files if they don't exist
- GPG functionality may be limited on Railway (bot handles this gracefully)
- Data files are ephemeral - consider persistent volumes for production
- All sensitive data should be in Railway environment variables, not in code

## Ready for Deployment! ðŸš€

Your MrZoidbergBot is now ready for Railway deployment. Follow the steps in `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` to deploy.
